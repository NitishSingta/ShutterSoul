# ShutterSoul

ShutterSoul is a multi-page photography website concept. It was created as a UI experiment using AI assistance, connecting several HTML pages for different sections like Gallery, Services, Bookings, and Contact.

## Features

- Responsive, modern UI for a photography brand
- Multiple pages: Home, Gallery, Services, Bookings, Contact
- CSS animations and effects (AOS, custom styles)
- No backend or dynamic functionality yetâ€”just static HTML/CSS/JS

## Getting Started

Just open `index.html` in your browser to explore the site. All pages are linked together for easy navigation.

## Future Plans

This is just an initial idea and UI prototype. I hope to contribute more features and improvements in the future, including backend integration and more interactive elements.
